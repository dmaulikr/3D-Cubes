# 3D Cubes
This repository contains a collection of iOS apps that use Firebase to allow multiple users to interact with a 3D cube. Not only will interactions be represented on the user's cube, but they will also be represented on the cubes of all other users of the app in real time.

### Color Cube
Each face of the cube is either red or yellow. Upon user interaction (tapping), a face will change colors.

### Layered Cube
Each face of the cube has a small 3D facelet on top. Upon user interaction (tapping), a facelet will disappear.
